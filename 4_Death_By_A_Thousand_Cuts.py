"""Death By A Thousand Cuts"""
print("""My heart, my hips, my body, my love Trying to find a part of me that you didn't\
 touch Gave up on me like I was a bad drug Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted\
 club Our songs, our films, united we stand Our country, guess it was a lawless land\
 Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand Paper cut stings from our paper thin plans\
 My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust Trying to find a part of me you didn't take up\
 Gave you too much but it wasn't enough But I'll be all right, it's just a thousand cuts
